A simple kinetic pathway is described which results in this proofreading when the reaction is strongly but nonspecifically driven, e.g., by phosphate hydrolysis. Protein synthesis, amino acid recognition, and DNA replication, all exhibit the features of this model. In each case, known reactions which otherwise appear to be useless or deleterious complications are seen to be essential to the proofreading function.},

	abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

We characterize, through in vivo optical imaging, the development and stability of the Bicoid morphogen gradient in Drosophila embryos that express a Bicoid-eGFP fusion protein. The gradient is established rapidly (∼1 hr after fertilization), with nuclear Bicoid concentration rising and falling during mitosis. Interphase levels result from a rapid equilibrium between Bicoid uptake and removal. Initial interphase concentration in nuclei in successive cycles is constant (±10\%), demonstrating a form of gradient stability, but it subsequently decays by approximately 30\%. Both direct photobleaching measurements and indirect estimates of Bicoid-eGFP diffusion constants (D ≤ 1 μm2/s) provide a consistent picture of Bicoid transport on short (∼min) time scales but challenge traditional models of long-range gradient formation. A new model is presented emphasizing the possible role of nuclear dynamics in shaping and scaling the gradient.},

We consider four measures of precision for the Bicoid morphogen in the Drosophila embryo: the concentration differences that distinguish neighboring cells, the limits set by the random arrival of Bicoid molecules at their targets (which depends on absolute concentration), the noise in readout of Bicoid by the activation of Hunchback, and the reproducibility of Bicoid concentration at corresponding positions in multiple embryos. We show, through a combination of different experiments, that all of these quantities are ∼10\%. This agreement among different measures of accuracy indicates that the embryo is not faced with noisy input signals and readout mechanisms; rather, the system exerts precise control over absolute concentrations and responds reliably to small concentration differences, approaching the limits set by basic physical principles.},

	abstract = {P Granule Conundrum
In many organisms, the presumptive germ cells can be distinguished from somatic cells by the presence of distinctive cytoplasmic granules. In Caenorhabditis elegans, these P granules are more or less uniformly distributed in the oocyte and one-cell stage of the fertilized egg. By the end of the first cleavage, however, the anterior cell is essentially free of P granules, whereas the posterior cell still displays a prominent population of granules. Exactly how this process occurs and whether it involves directed migration of the granules is unclear. Now Brangwynne et al. (p. 1729, published online 21 May; see the Perspective by Le Goff and Lecuit) provide evidence that localization occurs by a quite different mechanism, controlled dissolution and condensation of granule components. This type of cytoplasmic remodeling by physicochemical mechanisms can now be looked for in other cellular and developmental systems.
In sexually reproducing organisms, embryos specify germ cells, which ultimately generate sperm and eggs. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the first germ cell is established when RNA and protein-rich P granules localize to the posterior of the one-cell embryo. Localization of P granules and their physical nature remain poorly understood. Here we show that P granules exhibit liquid-like behaviors, including fusion, dripping, and wetting, which we used to estimate their viscosity and surface tension. As with other liquids, P granules rapidly dissolved and condensed. Localization occurred by a biased increase in P granule condensation at the posterior. This process reflects a classic phase transition, in which polarity proteins vary the condensation point across the cell. Such phase transitions may represent a fundamental physicochemical mechanism for structuring the cytoplasm.
Localization of RNA and protein-rich germ-cell granules occurs by controlled dissolution and condensation.

	abstract = {This textbook is aimed at newcomers to nonlinear dynamics and chaos, especially students taking a first course in the subject. The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples, and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors.A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with mathematical theory.In the twenty years since the first edition of this book appeared, the ideas and techniques of nonlinear dynamics and chaos have found application to such exciting new fields as systems biology, evolutionary game theory, and sociophysics. This second edition includes new exercises on these cutting-edge developments, on topics as varied as the curiosities of visual perception and the tumultuous love dynamics in Gone With the Wind.},

How can a protein find its site on a long DNA molecule among 10 6 –10 9 decoy sites? Here, we present our recent studies of the protein–DNA search problem. Seminal biophysical works suggested that the protein–DNA search is facilitated by 1D diffusion of the protein along DNA (sliding). We present a simple framework to calculate the mean search time and focus on several new aspects of the process such as the roles of DNA sequence and protein conformational flexibility. We demonstrate that coupling of DNA recognition with conformational transition within the protein–DNA complex is essential for fast search. To approach the complexity of the in vivo environment, we examine how the search can proceed at realistic DNA concentrations and binding constants. We propose a new mechanism for local distance-dependent search that is likely essential in bacteria. Simulations of the search on tightly packed DNA and crowded DNA demonstrate that our theoretical framework can be extended to correctly predicts search time in such complicated environments. We relate our findings to a broad range of experiments and summarize the results of our recent single-molecule studies of a eukaryotic protein (p53) sliding along DNA.},

We then proceeded to modify this picture by introducing first the features of inelastic macromolecular collisions in solution, then the effects of specific electrostatic fields set up around macromolecules of known structure at low ionic strengths, and finally the special rate enhancements available to DNA-protein interactions because of the particular geometry of the DNA molecule and the multiple conformations that can be assumed by the protein component.

Here we propose that loop extrusion underlies TAD formation. In this process, cis-acting loop-extruding factors, likely cohesins, form progressively larger loops, but stall at TAD boundaries due to interactions with boundary proteins, including CTCF. Using polymer simulations, we show that this model produces TADs and other fine features of Hi-C data. Contrary to typical illustrations, each TAD consists of multiple loops dynamically formed through extrusion, rather than a single static loop. Loop extrusion both explains diverse experimental observations, including the preferential orientation of CTCF motifs, enrichments of architectural proteins at TAD boundaries, and boundary deletion experiments, and makes specific predictions for depletion of CTCF versus cohesin. Finally, loop extrusion has additional, potentially far-ranging, consequences for processes including enhancer-promoter interactions, orientation-specific chromosomal looping, and compaction of mitotic chromosomes.,},

	abstract = {The positions of nucleosomes in eukaryotic genomes determine which parts of the DNA sequence are readily accessible for regulatory proteins and which are not. Genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions have revealed a salient pattern around transcription start sites, involving a nucleosome-free region (NFR) flanked by a pronounced periodic pattern in the average nucleosome density. While the periodic pattern clearly reflects well-positioned nucleosomes, the positioning mechanism is less clear. A recent experimental study by Mavrich et al. argued that the pattern observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is qualitatively consistent with a “barrier nucleosome model,” in which the oscillatory pattern is created by the statistical positioning mechanism of Kornberg and Stryer. On the other hand, there is clear evidence for intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes, and it is unclear to what extent these sequence preferences affect the observed pattern. To test the barrier nucleosome model, we quantitatively analyze yeast nucleosome positioning data both up- and downstream from NFRs. Our analysis is based on the Tonks model of statistical physics which quantifies the interplay between the excluded-volume interaction of nucleosomes and their positional entropy. We find that although the typical patterns on the two sides of the NFR are different, they are both quantitatively described by the same physical model with the same parameters, but different boundary conditions. The inferred boundary conditions suggest that the first nucleosome downstream from the NFR (the +1 nucleosome) is typically directly positioned while the first nucleosome upstream is statistically positioned via a nucleosome-repelling DNA region. These boundary conditions, which can be locally encoded into the genome sequence, significantly shape the statistical distribution of nucleosomes over a range of up to ∼1,000 bp to each side.},

	abstract = {Cytoskeletal microtubules have been proposed to influence cell shape and mechanics based on their ability to resist large-scale compressive forces exerted by the surrounding contractile cytoskeleton. Consistent with this, cytoplasmic microtubules are often highly curved and appear buckled because of compressive loads. However, the results of in vitro studies suggest that microtubules should buckle at much larger length scales, withstanding only exceedingly small compressive forces. This discrepancy calls into question the structural role of microtubules, and highlights our lack of quantitative knowledge of the magnitude of the forces they experience and can withstand in living cells. We show that intracellular microtubules do bear large-scale compressive loads from a variety of physiological forces, but their buckling wavelength is reduced significantly because of mechanical coupling to the surrounding elastic cytoskeleton. We quantitatively explain this behavior, and show that this coupling dramatically increases the compressive forces that microtubules can sustain, suggesting they can make a more significant structural contribution to the mechanical behavior of the cell than previously thought possible.},

	abstract = {The folding of chromatin in interphase cell nuclei was studied by fluorescent in situ sequences chromatin according to a random walk model. This model provides the basis for calculating the spacing of sequences along the linear DNA molecule from interphase distance measurements. An interphase mapping strategy based on this model was tested with 13 probes from a 4-megabase pair (Mbp) region of chromosome 4 containing the Huntington disease locus. The results confirmed the locations of the probes and showed that the remaining gap in the published maps of this region is negligible in size. Interphase distance measurements should facilitate construction of chromosome maps with an average marker density of one per 100 kbp, approximately ten times greater than that achieved by hybridization to metaphase chromosome. achieved by hybridization to metaphase chromosomes.},

	abstract = {The mechanism of facilitated translocation through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) is only poorly understood. Here, we present a kinetic analysis of the process using various model substrates. We find that the translocation capacity of NPCs is unexpectedly high, with a single NPC allowing a mass flow of nearly 100 MDa/s and rates in the order of 103 translocation events per second. Our data further indicate that high affinity interactions between the translocation substrate and NPC components are dispensable for translocation. We propose a ‘selective phase model’ that could explain how NPCs function as a permeability barrier for inert molecules and yet become selectively permeable for nuclear transport receptors and receptor–cargo complexes.},
