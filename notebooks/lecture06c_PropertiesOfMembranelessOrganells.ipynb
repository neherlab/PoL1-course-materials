    "The function of membraneless organelles continues to be poorly characterized, but several plausible hypotheses exist:\n",
    "  * **micro-reactors**: Droplets are greatly enriched for particular sets of proteins and RNAs. Hence specific reactions between these components are expected to be much faster in such droplets compared their speed if components were randomly distributed in the cytosol.\n",
    "  * **garbage dumps**: uncontrolled protein aggregation is dangerous. Hence droplets could represent a controlled way to absorb excess material that would otherwise be prone to uncontrolled aggregation. Similar, the droplets could serve to sequester harmful (damaged, misfolded, etc) proteins.\n",
    "  * **storage**: Membraneless organelles could be used for RNA storage that would be ready for transcription and/or modification when the conditions change.\n",

    "More research is required to uncover the roles of such organelles, but compartmentalization is a very common theme in cell biology, so there is every reason to assume these might have functions. "
