# Course materials for Physics of Life 1 at UniBas

This repository contains a script and notebooks used in Richard Neher's part of the *Physics of Life 1* course (co-taught with Sebastian Hiller) for 2nd year BSc students in Biology at the University of Basel. The material is taught in 6-7 weeks, three hours per week.
The main topics we touch on are

 - Quantitative reasoning in biology; relevant length, time and energy scales
 - Ordinary differential equations in biology, e.g.~growth processes
 - Simple models of gene regulation
 - Random walks and diffusion
 - Models of stiff and flexible polymers
 - Reaction-diffusion systems
 - Membrane-less organelles and liquid-liquid phase transitions

## Script
The script is typeset in Latex. A pdf output is included in the

## Notebooks
Much of the course material is provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
