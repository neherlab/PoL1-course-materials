# Course materials for Physics of Life 1 at UniBas

This repository contains a script and notebooks used in Richard Neher's part of the *Physics of Life 1* course (co-taught with Sebastian Hiller) for 2nd year BSc students in Biology at the University of Basel. The material is taught in 6-7 weeks, three hours per week.
The main topics we touch on are

 - Quantitative reasoning in biology; relevant length, time and energy scales
 - Ordinary differential equations in biology, e.g.~growth processes
 - Simple models of gene regulation
 - Random walks and diffusion
 - Models of stiff and flexible polymers
 - Reaction-diffusion systems
 - Membrane-less organelles and liquid-liquid phase transitions

## Lecture notes
The lecture notes are typeset in Latex. A pdf output is included in the

## Notebooks
Much of the course material is provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks are in the `notebooks` directory and can be viewed and executed in jupyter.

## Recorded lectures from previous years

During the COVID-19 pandemic, this course was not held in person. Instead, lectures were recorded. I provide links to these recordings here in case they might be useful for some. Note, however, that the content of the course is evolving over the years and these recordings from 2020 do not correspond exactly to the current lecture content.
